                        <p>The basic idea is to allow self-determining and confidential communication to exchange of data between real-world devices and applications of the Internet of things. Computer network area requires professionals with solid networking theory and practical hands-on experience.

                            Together with the fast-technological advancement in the field of computer networks and Information Technology industry, the need for a large number of skilled network experts also increased.
                            
                            Cisco Packet Tracer is an effective education simulation software that supports computer networking students to experiment and practice network tasks. Cisco Networking Academy Program (CNAP) introduced Packet Tracer as a tool for teaching and learning of computer network courses by providing “simulation, visualization, authoring, collaboration capabilities and assessment”
